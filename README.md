Introduction
The purpose of this Project is to familiarize myself with the writing Perl scripts that will echo
the user input.


---Program Input
• The program should continue to prompt for input and display the output after no input is
entered (hitting the Enter key without any data).

---Program Calculation
• The program should use a loop to calculate the following:
  o Number of lines read
o Longest line encountered (number of characters)
  o Total characters read
